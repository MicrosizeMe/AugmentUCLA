Cookies
* public browser saved data
* Signed cookies basically encrypt them, securing data

To secure cookies, a key is needed, called a cookie secret. These should be externalized. 
	EG 
	credentials.js
	module.exports = {
		cookieSecret:"q94539"
	}

Cookies in Express

As with all things, you need to include cookie-parser middleware. 
	npm install --save cookie-parser

	app.use(require('cookie-parser')(credentials.cookieSecret))

	To send a cookie as a part of a response, 

	Unsigned: 
	res.cookie('monster', 'nomnom!');
	res.cookie('signed_monster', 'nomnom!', { signed: true });

	To get cookie values from client, 

	var monster = req.cookies.monster;
	var signedMonster req.signedCookies.signed_monster;

	To clear a cookie,

	res.clearCookie('monster');

You can set other properties
* domain: controls the domain the cookie is associated with
* Other api on 104

Sessions
* Basically, cookie stores session ID, server stores other info
* Using sessions
	
	app.use(require('cookie-parser')(credentials.cookieSecret));
	app.use(require('express-session')({
		resave: false,
		saveUnitialized: false,
		secret: credentials.cookieSecret
	}));
