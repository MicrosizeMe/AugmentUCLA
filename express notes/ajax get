using post requests

you need to require the body-parser middleware

npm install --save body-parser

app.use(require('body-parser').urlencode({ extended:true }));

Such code will add req.body, which contains form fields to be made available.

Server code for handling ajax post requests



app.post('/process', function(req, res) {
	console.log(req.body.field);

	if (req.xhr || req.accepts('json,html') === 'json') {
		do stuff
	}
});

req.xhr is true if the request is ajax. req.accepts will try to determine the approrpiate response.
	EG req.accepts('json,html') tests if the reponse should take json or html
		* Basically, if the request is ajax or requests json, it will return that.

TODO: Look up how to do file uploads later

For file uploads, it is necessary to specify the type in the form as enctype="multipart/form-data". There's probably an express lib for this, look it up
