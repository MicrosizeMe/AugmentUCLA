Middleware

A function that takes in a request, a response, and a "next" function. 
Registered by app.use

Express acts as a pipeline, where middleware affects subsequent middleware
* Order matters
* Thus, last middle ware is commonly 404

Toy example: 

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
	console.log('stuff');
	next();
});

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
	console.log('more');
	res.send('Done')
});


app.use(function(req, res, next) {
	console.log('never called');
});
